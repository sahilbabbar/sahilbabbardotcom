This edition of the book has Rand's original 1947 essays with modifications made for 1970 edition. As mentioned on the inside of the book's front jacket - "Word for word and page for page, the text with its original fonts, typographical style, sources and footnotes, captions and prefaces, appears as it did in the original".

This book is all about how to think like a designer or rather a "good" designer according to the author, Paul Rand; who was and is a towering figure in the design industry. This book is only 95 glossy pages thick with excerpts from Rand's work done over decades from graphic posters, book/magazine covers, newspaper advertisements to label designs and logos of prominent companies like IBM, ABC, Westinghouse, UPS.

Paul Rand remains quite assertive about the idea of doing good design and doesn't shy away to call out on shortcomings of design or designers. Like he asserts - "Graphic design... is not good design if it does not co-operate as an instrument in the service of communication." He presents the fundamental aspects and participants in design or design process like beauty, utility, symbol, humour, typography, logo shapes, reader’s attention.

The book is divided in 9 sections:

1. The Beautiful and the Useful
2. The Designer’s Problem
3. The Symbol in Advertising
4. Versatility of the Symbol
5. The Role of Humour
6. Imagination and the Image
7. Reader Participation
8. Yesterday and Today
9. Typographic Form and Expression

The following sections offer a summarized view of the above sections without making it too elaborate, but capturing key messages given by Rand.

The author comments on the visual communication in general, by stating that one should take it as the “embodiment” of form and function and integration of the beautiful and the useful. Moreover, whenever a designer tries to break these integrations then the resultant object looses its esthetic value.

Moreover, Rand quotes John Dewey from ‘Art as Experience, Ethereal Things’ that most of the objects made today have very low or no esthetic value; and he provides the reason for the same by expressing that the product should be an experience, a living entity who lives via enjoyment. But if it’s an inverse then, he asserts “No matter how useful it is for special and limited ends, it will not be useful in the ultimate degree...” and by using the phrase ‘ultimate degree’, Rand also provides a motive or target or ‘Why?’ to designing great products - “...that of contributing directly and liberally to an expanding and enriched life.”

Lastly, he conveys that beauty should not be treated as an end in itself as there is much more to it and goes hand-in-hand with utility.

Paul Rand clarifies that a designer’s job is to re-create or restate the problem statement at hand, by identifying the what, why, where, who, when, how; thus breaking down complexity into simpler manageable chunks. Moreover, he states that a designer should begin working on a problem statement, with a clear canvas, where he/she doesn’t bring along any pre-conceived ideas or formulas; rather give birth to that idea by following a diligent process of careful study, observation and introspection.

Then, Rand goes on to define what is a ‘symbol’. He states that humans think and remember in the form of symbols and thus, it is “the common language between artist and spectator.” In its true essence, a symbol is not what it looks like, but what it does or convey to the reader. For example, “...crucifix, aside from its religious implications, is a demonstration of perfect form as well - a union of the aggressive vertical(male) and the passive horizontal(female).” Further he takes the example of Ying and Yang which depict two powers balancing out each other and giving stability to the creation.

> The circle as opposed to the square, for instance, as a pure form evokes a specific esthetic sensation; ideologically it is the symbol for eternity, without beginning or end.

In continuation, the next focus area is the role of humor in design and overall entertainment, in visual design and how it almost always succeeds to attract reader's attention. So, humor acts as an catalyst for creating goodwill, confidence towards the product or service.

> "True humor", says Thomas Carlyle, "springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love, it issues not in laughter, but in still smiles, which lie far deeper."

Then, Rand expresses his thoughts over the role of imagination and ideas, and how to remain original while designing and making the reader participate in the design using collages and montages, that further allows the designer to give the message in one shot, in one picture.

Towards the conclusion, the author elaborates on the designs made using camera-less photography, i.e. photograms and their usage along with effectiveness. He also demonstrates the power of repetition as an "emotional force" is generated in the reader and halts on the topic of typography, its forms and different usages to achieve different level of functions.

Overall, this book captures the opinions of Paul Rand on visual and graphic design, in a somewhat philosophical way and not so-easy-to-understand vocabulary, with legible graphical records of Rand's designs. The book requires the reader to re-visit multiple times to realize what the author wants to convey, but it also offers a great insight into the thought process of one of the accomplished designers of the last century.

It's one of those books which require you to sip some coffee, read few lines and contemplate, periodically looking outside the window.
